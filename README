Websubs

AS3 wrapper for the Moogaloop videoplayer from www.vimeo.com with advanced subtitles support.
 
Currently, only vimeo.com and SRT subtitles are supported. 
Youtube and other subtitle formats will be implemented in the future.

A jQuery plugin for simple usage is included. 

A solution for the non-Flash, HTML5 video embed from vimeo.com is prepared in the file aleksic.websubs.js and needs to be implemented into websubs.js.
