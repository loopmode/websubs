1
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,960
For me,
the most important question today is

2
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,400
how do we sit together
and lead a discussion?

3
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,120
Not just with one or two persons,
but all of us on this planet.

4
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,760
To start to raise the questions
about what's important.

5
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,200
-For me, what's important.
-Are you bending the truth...

6
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,240
about climate change?

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,040
Why are African states
less developed than Western states?

8
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
I'd like to know...

9
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,200
What is the proper balance
between Jewish values

10
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
and other values in a democracy?

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,480
-I have a few questions.
-Why do they dislike Americans?

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How does an individual relate
to the group in the 21st Century?

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This place has a lot of history.

14
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
In this place, they used to burn books

15
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,840
by those who say things
that other people don't like to know.

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
And that's why we've come here
to August-Bebelplatz in Berlin,

17
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,040
where books were burned,
thoughts were burned.

18
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,640
Freedom of speech was burned here.

19
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,880
THE TABLE OF FREE VOICES,
BEBELPLATZ, BERLIN

20
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,000
It's wonderful to see all the
beautiful faces around this table.

21
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,160
We have a long day ahead of us,
so we'll go right into the programme.

22
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
Today, we ask and we begin

23
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,000
to discover answers to 100 questions

24
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,000
chosen from thousands, donated
by people from all around the world.

25
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,160
We will ask them all over the course
of the next nine hours...

26
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,800
In eight sessions
of around 45 minutes

27
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,280
covering eight themes
of global importance.

28
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,680
-Chinese.
-From here. Directly from here.

29
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,840
Have you been to my country?

30
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
No, unfortunately, I have not.

31
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,640
Together, we come together as one
to celebrate our diversity

32
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
and to gather
a multiplicity of viewpoints.

33
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,760
-Thank you for being here with us.
-At the Table of Free Voices.

34
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,800
-Question one.
-From Anonymous, USA.

35
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
"What is today's
most important unreported story?"

36
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,320
You can start with your answer.

37
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,800
What ought to be reported today

38
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,880
and definitely does not

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,240
is how much life costs.

40
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,760
The price of life on this planet.

41
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,640
We are going from crisis to crisis

42
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
and we only report
a portion of the story.

43
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,440
When the guns of battle are silenced,

44
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
we then forget about that country,

45
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,480
about that region
that has suffered conflict.

46
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,840
And we go to report a different story,
and when we do so...

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Well, I would begin with Darfur,

48
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,080
with the extermination of populations,

49
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,320
just because they're of
another religion or another race.

50
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,600
And the world
is not interested in them,

51
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,280
because they have no resources,
no oil.

52
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,440
For me,
the most unreported story of today

53
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
is the truth behind global terrorism.

54
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,040
We have no idea, really no idea,

55
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,200
what the truth behind it is.

56
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,240
Who is alive? Who is dead?

57
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,520
Who is advancing it?
Who is pioneering it?

58
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,680
Who is making use of it

59
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,200
in "his" or "their" favour.

60
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,320
The children who have been enslaved.

61
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Human trafficking.

62
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
The millions of people
crossing borders illegally

63
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,280
in search for a better life.

64
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,840
I think today's
most important unreported story

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,640
is the story
of the young girl who died

66
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
ten minutes ago of malaria.

67
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,840
She died needlessly,

68
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,560
because the drugs that would be able
to kill the malaria parasite exist,

69
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,120
and are cheap.

70
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,640
But she didn't get those drugs.

71
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,600
And she died,

72
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,000
and just now another child died,

73
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,120
and this story goes unreported.

74
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,840
I don't think there is

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,480
today's one most important
unreported story.

76
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,320
There are many unreported stories
throughout the world.

77
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,240
The good things
that are happening in the world.

78
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,160
We don't hear about the good things.
There are wonderful things happening.

79
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,200
All we ever hear about is bad news.

80
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,480
The death, the destruction, wars,

81
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,880
killing, murders, rapes.

82
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Problems.
If you squeeze a newspaper,

83
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,360
it seems to bleed.

84
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
Thank you.

85
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,840
Question twelve from Judy Twedt,

86
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,800
24, Denver, USA.

87
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,120
"Should we have the right
to choose where we live?"

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Now, that's an interesting question.

89
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,080
I like it.

90
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
We are just born.

91
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,000
We're just born
somewhere on planet Earth,

92
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
and if we don't want to stay there,

93
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,240
we go somewhere else.

94
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
But then, when we do,
we're discriminated against.

95
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,760
I arrived two days ago and on the 11th
I have to leave again,

96
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,440
because my visa
only lasts for four days.

97
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,840
As a Colombian,

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
as a citizen of the world,

99
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,480
I have no right
to enter this paradise,

100
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,480
the paradise of the First World,
except for four days.

101
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,400
I believe we should have the right
to choose where we live.

102
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,080
We live in a world
where capital can move,

103
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
where goods can move.

104
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Why is there so much hysteria
about people moving?

105
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,960
For example,
one time I wanted to go to Dubai,

106
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
but because I have

107
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,640
a 1951 Geneva Convention passport,

108
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,640
I was not allowed.

109
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,640
And the reason they gave me for this

110
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
was that I didn't belong anywhere.

111
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
Everybody wants to live in a place
that is free of war.

112
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,320
Everybody wants to live
a harmonious existence.

113
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
But some people can buy that
and others cannot.

114
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Some people
can lay claim to that right,

115
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,640
and others
are just not in a position to do so.

116
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,640
Yes, we all should have the right
to live wherever we want,

117
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,200
but all of us
should be able to afford to do so.

118
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,400
Sometimes you have to move
to be able to support your family.

119
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,240
If you're crossing borders,
and you're not recognized by a state,

120
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,320
Does that mean you're illegal
by definitions of the state?

121
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,320
I think as humans,
we can't say another human is illegal.

122
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,960
The people
who are moving are doing so,

123
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,960
because they are desperate.

124
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,880
They're taking enormous risks.

125
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,640
Look at the people arriving
in the Canary Islands.

126
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
Every week in makeshift boats,

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
they're arriving
on the beach by the hundreds.

128
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,000
These people are absolutely desperate.

129
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,640
Otherwise, they would not have left.

130
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,880
That's not a choice. That's not
choosing where I'm going to live.

131
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,440
You're not going to choose to risk
nine chances out of ten of drowning,

132
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,520
or being killed
before you actually arrive.

133
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,080
That's not a choice!

134
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,200
You could also ask the question,
shouldn't we have...

135
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,000
the right to remain where we are?

136
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,760
This is a very urgent question
for many, many people on this Earth.

137
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,920
Tibetan people,
such as myself, being Tibetan,

138
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,280
we don't have this right.

139
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,400
Yes, we can live in our country,

140
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,000
but we can't necessarily
do what we want to.

141
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,720
The day the law

142
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,600
effectively realizes the possibility

143
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,720
of granting this right
to all people without restriction,

144
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,840
on that day
humanity will have done more

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,240
than pass over a boundary.

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,880
It will have attained
a degree of evolution,

147
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,840
which is desirable

148
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,240
for all cultures and nations.

149
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
It's important...

150
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
that we can live where we want to.

151
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,240
Everyone needs a nest.

152
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,680
Even the birds need a nest.

153
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,760
Human beings need their homes.

154
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Question 19, from Claire Mackintosh,

155
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,000
25, Brisbane, Australia.

156
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,000
"What are the basic dignities
that each human being deserves,"

157
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,400
"and why do we let
so many people go without them?"

158
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,640
Basic dignity is human dignity,

159
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,760
their pride, so they can
hold their heads up, not down.

160
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They don't have to be scared.

161
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Maybe they live in a remote village.

162
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
In some part of a developing country.
So what?

163
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,360
They should be standing straight...

164
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,840
We let so many people go without them,

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,240
so we can let other people
do what they do.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,560
Take lands.

167
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,600
Drop bombs.

168
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,120
Take water.

169
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,960
Control minds.

170
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,080
All for ourselves
and nothing for other people

171
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,640
seems to have been,
in every age of the world,

172
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,240
the vile maxim
of the masters of mankind.

173
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,240
All for ourselves
and nothing for other people.

174
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,840
It's Adam Smith who said that,
Adam Smith, the father of capitalism.

175
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He knew that was the tendency.

176
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,160
All for ourselves
and nothing for other people.

177
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,240
The Universal Declaration
of Human Rights

178
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,400
is what should be available

179
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,320
for people throughout the world.

180
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,560
We should not accept that anyone
is denied those basic human rights,

181
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,880
the basic human right
to live a decent life,

182
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,640
to have access

183
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,040
to food, shelter and education.

184
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,640
It is unacceptable
that in today's world,

185
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,240
there are children dying of hunger.

186
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,000
It is unacceptable
that in today's world,

187
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,760
there are children
who have no shelter.

188
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,000
To prepare myself for this question,
I used the Internet, Wikipedia,

189
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,840
and I re-read the United Nations
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

190
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and it made me cry.

191
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,760
I just wept. It is so beautiful.

192
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Let's put it in every passport.

193
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,840
My father was exterminated
at the age of 37,

194
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,640
my mother at the same age.

195
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,160
My sisters were exterminated

196
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,240
at the age of fourteen and six
and twelve and sixteen.

197
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,840
I survived, and life has become
very precious for me.

198
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,040
And I assume it is also precious
for every human being on this planet.

199
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,000
And yet it is often taken away
for the wrong reasons.

200
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,240
We teach our children that our lives
are worth more than other people's.

201
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,640
Outsiders,
people with a different colour skin,

202
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,480
people that have less than we do,
people that don't speak our language.

203
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,120
People...

204
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
The other. The other people.

205
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What happens oftentimes
is that those people

206
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
are really seen
as "them" and not "us",

207
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,640
and there's not much attention
paid to or much concern for

208
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,920
the basic rights and dignities
of those people.

209
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,720
But I think you have to think about
what "we" means in this question.

210
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Who are "we" and who are "they"?

211
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,640
Babies, when they cry,
you cannot distinguish

212
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,800
whether it's a boy, a girl,
what their nationality is,

213
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,000
or what the mother's religion is.

214
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,880
It's only one voice.

215
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Don't forget. It's only one sound.
We must remember this.

216
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,800
I guess if people really
saw each other as their brother,

217
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,640
and could imagine
that each person out there

218
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
was their child or relative,
it would be really different.

219
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,320
If we could really
open our hearts that wide.

220
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
Everyone can gain

221
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,400
human dignity for themselves.

222
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,840
Before this, though,
one must leave behind

223
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
the self-imposed oppression
of politics, ideology, religion,

224
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,160
and nationalistic narrow-mindedness.

225
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,360
I come...

226
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,880
I come from the jungle,

227
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,120
where I lived most of my life
with tribes,

228
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,960
and where

229
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
the question of freedom

230
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,360
is much more meaningful
than it is here.

231
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,240
I've never known any beings
that are more free than they are,

232
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
the indigenous people.

233
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
No, I never have.

234
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,240
Do you believe this project
can change something?

235
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I knew it from the moment
that this murmur first began,

236
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,840
and this babble of voices.

237
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,240
It sent a shiver down my spine,

238
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,880
and I realized that
something will come of this.

239
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,800
I was reminded
a little of "Wings of Desire".

240
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,400
There are these angels
which hear all these voices.

241
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,440
There's a similar kind
of murmur the whole time.

242
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,840
I could hear this same murmur here,
only it was real.

243
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,240
All these people
were actually thinking aloud.

244
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, hey! Did you see Bianca?
I think she's over there.

245
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,400
There she is.

246
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,440
I think she showed up late.

247
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,840
Can you do me a big favour?

248
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,560
Don't move it when I'm talking,
because that immediately...

249
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Could you do it before or after
or when I stop talking,

250
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,160
because if you do it when I'm talking
my concentration...

251
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
-I do it when I get notes from others.
-Sure.

252
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,400
Question 28 from Andrew,

253
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
22, Frankfurt, Germany.

254
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,880
"What if all Chinese people
want a car?"

255
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,720
Please begin.

256
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
This question is a bit racist.

257
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Why not?

258
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Everybody needs a car.

259
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,520
Why do you only talk
about the Chinese?

260
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,680
If you go to America,
every family has more than three cars.

261
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
Why Chinese? Everybody wants a car.

262
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
Italian, French and German people
that don't have a car, want a car.

263
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,240
What if all Indians want a car?

264
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,040
What if all Africans want a car?

265
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,480
If all Chinese people
wanted to have a car,

266
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,600
and assuming
that they would want to drive

267
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,240
the biggest, fastest
and most powerful cars,

268
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,920
then the skies above us would darken.

269
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,120
Not enough roads, many accidents,

270
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,360
not enough car parking space,

271
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
too much pollution.

272
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,840
What if all Chinese people want a car?

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,840
Then all German people

274
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,880
must be turned into automobile workers

275
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,040
to produce cars for the Chinese
until all the Germans are exhausted.

276
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
It's an impossible story.

277
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,080
The car of today in the wealthy world

278
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,840
utilizes 2 to 3 percent of the energy
in the gas tank

279
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to actually move the driver.

280
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,880
The rest is lost
in moving the weight of the frame,

281
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,840
and the weight of the engine,
lost in heat and friction.

282
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
We've devised an enormously
sophisticated set

283
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
of very badly designed vehicles.

284
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,760
Just to move one person
from one place to another.

285
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,400
Petroleum prices will continue
their sharp upward movement.

286
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,240
And economic chaos
in the West, at the most,

287
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,840
or, at the very least,
the grim, inevitable realization

288
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that something has to be done

289
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,080
about the excess consumption
of fossil fuels

290
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,840
in the United States of America
and other Western countries

291
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,920
will be impressed
upon people's consciousness.

292
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,200
China, for a long time,

293
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,600
was a nation of bicycles.

294
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm encouraged that Chinese automakers

295
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,080
are looking
at the ecological impacts of the cars

296
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,240
and working very hard
at thinking about electric cars.

297
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
China has a huge opportunity,

298
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,080
and a huge responsibility

299
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,560
to industrialize in a way
that works for its people,

300
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,360
and for its environment,

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,040
and for the world.

302
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,040
What's behind the question
is not so much the Chinese people,

303
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,040
but a metaphor for a situation,
which is clearly unsustainable.

304
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,840
We cannot ask of them

305
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,560
what we're not prepared
to do ourselves.

306
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,840
What we need to do
is learn from our mistakes,

307
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,920
from the way we've lived,
from irrational and irresponsible ways

308
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,320
in which we have lived our life.

309
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,640
The problem is not
how many people want a car,

310
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
but that the door to human desires

311
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,800
has been opened interminably.

312
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,400
How can we close the door again

313
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,040
after opening it to our infinite,
possessive desires?

314
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
-Everything okay?
-Everything okay.

315
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,560
-How you doing?
-Good. A little bit exhausted.

316
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
-That's too much?
-Yeah.

317
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,880
This is just so cool
to be here doing this.

318
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,680
-Is it?
-The Nazis burned the books here.

319
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,400
Oh, now I get it. That stack of books
is there because of that.

320
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Jesus, I didn't realize that...

321
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,200
Willem.
How many questions do you have left?

322
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,360
-After all these questions.
-You want to know?

323
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm speaking so much
about all the problems.

324
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm setting it all on fire!

325
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,120
-Am I doing okay?
-Question 33...

326
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,920
is from the New York-based novelist,

327
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,560
Siri Hustvedt, who asks...

328
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm very curious to know, to find out,

329
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,880
how consumer culture

330
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
actually influences

331
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,840
the personalities,
the ways people live,

332
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,680
the way they think,

333
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,240
inside themselves, in a given culture.

334
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
How it becomes part of us,

335
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,560
and what it means to be able to resist

336
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,640
that visual and verbal culture,
it seems to me...

337
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,320
"It seems to me, it's always reducing"

338
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,240
"and simplifying reality
into something"

339
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
"that can be easily bought and sold."

340
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,080
I think...

341
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,120
Consumer culture...

342
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,480
It functions to keep creating

343
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,520
a desire in the society,
in the community,

344
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,760
that there is something new,
something better, more useful...

345
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,640
Man needs nothing.

346
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,800
He needs only himself.

347
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,840
He needs love.

348
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
There are enough coffee pots
in the world.

349
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,880
We're surrounded by enough gadgets.
There are enough chairs.

350
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,040
Use one of the many hundreds
that are already there,

351
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,840
and then put your extra energy into
developing things that really matter.

352
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,840
All this forms part of a culture
of prostitution.

353
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Our values have become prostituted,

354
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,880
and humanity
is just a big prostitution machine.

355
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,760
We created monsters,

356
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,440
monsters of agricultural development.

357
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,480
McDonald's cows are killed and there's
no ceremony of killing the animal.

358
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,640
There's no honouring, no thanking
the animal for providing food for us.

359
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,320
So when there's no ceremony,
the food we eat becomes bad.

360
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
And guess what?

361
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,400
Where McDonald's is eaten

362
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,400
people become sick.

363
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,560
What do you expect?
There's no ceremony.

364
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,040
The most powerful people
on the face of the planet

365
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,040
are the ones
who can affect the most minds, who...

366
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,240
who can influence human behaviour,

367
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
and social movements,

368
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,200
and the way in which
societies view themselves,

369
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,200
the way they walk, the way they talk,
things they eat, they drink and so on.

370
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,440
It's all a matter of economics.

371
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a model that is destroying us.

372
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,720
It's a model that is consuming us.

373
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
What we really need to look at

374
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,480
is the free market itself,

375
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,640
and see how we
can really bring in

376
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,280
the whole aspect of ethics.

377
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Wealth in order to share, to care,

378
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,800
and to live happily
with oneself and others.

379
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,440
And the deepest, the best wealth,
is how to serve others.

380
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
Question 37

381
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,160
is from Tom Henze,
30, Berlin, Germany.

382
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,800
"Does our wealth
depend on the Third World being poor?"

383
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,240
The expression "Third World"
is truly an arrogant claim.

384
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,240
It is not a Third World,
it's just a world

385
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,000
that has developed differently
or hasn't developed as fast.

386
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,640
But it is not the Third World.
What's the First World then?

387
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,040
What is that definition
of the Third World anyway?

388
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,800
Is there a First World,
a Second World and a Third World?

389
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,760
Not really.

390
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,360
One world?

391
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Not doing so well?
Humans fucking it up?

392
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,400
I mean, if our wealth depends
on the Third World being poor,

393
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,520
then we're in trouble,
we're in trouble...

394
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,320
They started by taking the gold away.

395
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,160
But for indigenous people

396
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
gold didn't have the same value
as it did for capitalists.

397
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Africa has been the cradle of mankind,

398
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,320
and I stand very clearly on this,
and say that Africa

399
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,960
is also going to be
the deathbed of capitalism.

400
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Oh plundered Africa...

401
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,840
Africa, terrible Africa.

402
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,640
It's impossible to talk about Africa
without feeling...

403
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,120
without feeling our hearts twinge.

404
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,240
Those who are well-fed
never understand

405
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,040
what it feels like to be hungry.

406
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,800
A Nigerian chief said:

407
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,000
"If you won't share your wealth,
we'll share our poverty with you."

408
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,240
If you want global peace, we have
to talk about equitable distribution.

409
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,520
We also have to understand
that all of the resources

410
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,720
are shared by all and they are,
first of all, for those in need.

411
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,640
Real property is property by need.
It comes about through need.

412
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:05,000
When I need a glass of water,
then it is mine by right of need.

413
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,080
Fair... "Fair" is not a word

414
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,120
that you hear in economics too much.

415
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,160
There is a connection
that we have to make

416
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,560
as to the poverty of the people,

417
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,960
the wealth of the land,
and be observant as to

418
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,600
where this wealth is going.

419
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,840
What I believe
globalization is really about

420
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,640
is forming global family,
moving out of what I call

421
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,640
a juvenile species mode
of hostile competition,

422
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,800
and into a more mature mode
of cooperation.

423
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,000
This has happened to many
species all through evolution

424
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,600
and it's our turn now as humans
to do this.

425
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,680
I make it very simple.

426
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,720
One is joining
in the generosity of the divine,

427
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,800
which is a power of giving.

428
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,640
All life is given to us.

429
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,720
And those who do that
are "for giving".

430
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,840
And if your life
is centred around getting,

431
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,880
then you're joining in the culture
of "for getting".

432
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
So the choice is to be part of
"for getting" and being forgotten,

433
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,360
or part of "for giving"
and being forgiven.

434
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I like that!
That's great.

435
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,240
-He said it for me, my neighbour.
-Repeat. Repeat.

436
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,520
Yes. Can you come and sit in my seat
and say it for me?

437
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,840
I would like it if we had
more interaction in this process.

438
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,640
I'm enlivened
by sharing with somebody.

439
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,600
My brain doesn't, my brain doesn't...
I mean, this! Talking to you...

440
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Talking to you!

441
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,640
-Hi, sweetheart.
Hi! How are you?

442
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Are you having fun, baby?

443
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,680
-Are you having fun?
-Yeah.

444
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,240
Because you're so smart.
You're such a genius.

445
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,000
Answers just roll off your tongue.

446
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,640
-I don't know, I don't know.
-I don't know!

447
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
We're part of a big experiment.

448
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,160
It's not about the questions.
This is about us.

449
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,400
Go ahead.

450
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,880
Thank you.

451
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,080
While you were giving your answers
to that last question,

452
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,400
I walked through the circle and could
see all your faces, hear your voices,

453
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,920
see your expressions.

454
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,680
And it was deeply moving
for me to see

455
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,520
everything that I saw
as I walked through the circle.

456
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,560
It's such a diverse group
that we have here.

457
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,000
We're our own United Nations!

458
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,720
I saw people from Africa,
from Asia, Australia,

459
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,520
from Europe and the Americas.

460
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,960
It's beautiful that we're all here
investing in the future.

461
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,360
Question 41.

462
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,640
From Adrienn Meszaros,
30, Budapest, Hungary.

463
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,600
"Is there a modern version
of colonialism?"

464
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,280
Yes.

465
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,560
There is a modern version
of colonialism.

466
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,760
And it's called debt.

467
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
It is called debt,

468
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,720
followed by
the structural adjustment policies

469
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,280
imposed by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.

470
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,600
A lot of this money
coming to developing countries

471
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,000
is used to control the sovereignty
of our own governments,

472
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,760
of our own people...

473
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,440
The Bank and the Fund say,
if you're going to pay back your debt,

474
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,800
and you must pay back your debt,

475
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,000
then you have to put interest rates
way up...

476
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,720
That makes it harder for businesses
to borrow and to employ people.

477
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,600
You've got to privatize
everything in sight,

478
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,800
so that gives big opportunities

479
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,440
to foreign companies and local elites

480
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,120
to buy up all of
the previously public companies.

481
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,200
The United States of America
was itself built

482
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,080
on the decimation of an entire people.

483
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,880
Europe has been built

484
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,160
on sucking out the Congo,

485
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,040
on sucking out
the gold and diamonds of South Africa.

486
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Slavery was about
the exploitation of raw materials.

487
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,000
Today it's about oil.

488
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,080
Today it's about diamonds,
minerals and primary resources.

489
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
The countries...

490
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,400
the Latin American countries,

491
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,560
continue to suffer exploitation,

492
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,120
the exploitation of their resources.

493
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,440
All of these policies
have been very beneficial

494
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,480
to a tiny minority
of the people in these countries.

495
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,880
Just like vampires.
They are vampires!

496
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,840
They use the energy,
the strength and the lives of others,

497
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,880
for their own economic prosperity.

498
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,000
It's modern economic colonialism
based on globalization,

499
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,320
but its structure
is almost exactly the same

500
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,640
as it has been for
four or five hundred years.

501
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,120
It's better than colonialism,
because it doesn't need an army.

502
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,960
It doesn't need an administration.

503
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,240
It doesn't cost you anything,
the state, the powers intervening...

504
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,640
"We are children of a world
that has enough for everyone."

505
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,000
"But so many remain hungry,
while so few are well fed."

506
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
"One will eat, the other suffers."

507
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,640
"This is how it's always been."

508
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,800
"Other nations must be poor,
so that rich ones can be rich."

509
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,480
And this is a really ideal system,

510
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,560
because it isn't even very visible.

511
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,720
Colonialism is visible.

512
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,240
People think this is rotten.
Those pictures taken.

513
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,240
But debt is invisible, and it works
just as well, even more efficiently.

514
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,960
I don't like to be sitting here
as an American talking about this,

515
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,040
but this is the underbelly
of the real world that we live in.

516
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,000
It's very real.
It has caused enormous misery,

517
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,400
and we have to know
what's going on in our world

518
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,400
in order to change it.

519
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,560
There must be
some democratic forms of life

520
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,200
and forms of organization

521
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,400
that can sidestep all imperial

522
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,200
and colonial forms of subjugation.

523
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
That's the great question
of the 21st Century.

524
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:21,320
Question 45
from Katharina, 24, Germany.

525
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,480
"Why do we still believe more
in nationality than in humanity?"

526
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,320
It is by the conditioning of mind
that we are

527
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,240
trained, trained, trained
all the time,

528
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
that we are part of
a national identity.

529
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That is how we see it.

530
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,400
And, within a nation,
again it gets down to

531
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,920
smaller and smaller
and smaller identities...

532
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,360
And so we are fearful.

533
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,600
We have been put into a framework
to protect ourselves.

534
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,560
We're so insecure.

535
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
We do not know who is for us,
and who is not for us,

536
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
and that has destroyed humanity.

537
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Let me give you an example.

538
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,880
In Iraq now, my country Iraq,

539
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,560
most people cling to

540
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,920
and trust

541
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,360
only their own people,

542
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,800
or their neighbours,
or others from their city.

543
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,760
Before, we did not ask
who a person was,

544
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,560
where they came from,
from which city,

545
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,520
from which tribe or family.

546
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,920
We would be friendly, that's all.

547
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,640
It is security,
psychological security,

548
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,280
that enables people to feel
an expanded sense of self,

549
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,760
that enables them
to respect difference.

550
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,600
It is when people feel frightened,
scared, cut off,

551
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,560
that intolerance grows,

552
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,840
and in the nation states today
people are being manipulated

553
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,720
through the mass media

554
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,520
to learn to hate the other,
whom they have never met.

555
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,240
We live in a world,
where we have been conditioned

556
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,800
to be tribal, to be nativist,

557
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,080
to be nationalist.

558
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,160
Of course,
it's important to understand

559
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,400
that nationalism is really fanaticism.

560
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
I believe that within each of us

561
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,720
there is a racist dictator.

562
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
I'm convinced of this.

563
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,440
Because we are closer to the family
than we are to the clan,

564
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,520
closer to the clan than to the tribe,

565
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,280
closer to the tribe
than to the nation,

566
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:03,320
closer to the nation
than to humanity.

567
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,720
I don't believe in nationality at all,

568
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,400
and I think more and more of us
in the 21st Century,

569
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,800
children of the world of possibility,
children of the future tense,

570
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,960
live in the passageways between
nations, cultures and categories,

571
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,160
outside the traditional definitions.

572
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,280
Our affiliations are not to nations,

573
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,840
or to the traditional order,
but to something beyond that.

574
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,560
I believe that, to a certain extent,

575
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,880
the concept of nationality
is beginning to erode

576
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,200
as we turn into a kind of
genuinely transnational people.

577
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,120
Sometimes the worst enemy

578
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,480
is our own perception.

579
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,560
Thank you.

580
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,480
Question 48 from Glen,
Cape Town, South Africa.

581
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,520
"How do we stop
our governments from going to war?"

582
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,800
I come from a land
where there has never been a war,

583
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,840
so I do not know anything about war,

584
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,240
but I do know of the suffering
you people have experienced.

585
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,240
Me? I come from the land of peace.

586
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,960
Where nothing but peace
had been in existence.

587
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,560
Where no one fears being shot.

588
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Where no one is aiming at you.

589
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Where no one fights for land.

590
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,600
We go to war: you, me, us.

591
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,920
Governments don't go to war.
Governments send us to war.

592
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,400
We pay the price,

593
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,480
and the price that we pay
is not only physical.

594
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,560
The price that we pay is psychic.

595
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,240
We lose our moral groundedness.
We lose ourselves.

596
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,840
It's really a shame.

597
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The big powers should be ashamed

598
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,720
of what they are doing
with the civilizations. Killing them?

599
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm a survivor of war in Bosnia.

600
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,240
For three and a half years
of my childhood,

601
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,080
millions of bombs exploded
in my city, and...

602
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,000
To hear a bomb explode
is an experience

603
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,640
that can't be explained or described,

604
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
because you feel it in your body.

605
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,760
I remember
just my whole body reacting

606
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,160
to such loudness and destruction.

607
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,360
My heart would jump every time,
millions of times.

608
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,400
There were times when it felt like
my heart could no longer take it,

609
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,720
like it would just burst
into millions of pieces.

610
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,200
We're nothing but collateral damage.
We're not talking about numbers.

611
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,360
We're not talking about
destroyed lives or families.

612
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,480
We're talking about collateral damage.
It's just numbing.

613
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,200
Because we're not seeing a face.
It is distant.

614
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,200
The political process has lost touch

615
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,520
with the reality that war
is only about economics.

616
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It is incomprehensible how,
nowadays,

617
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,160
the world powers

618
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,920
can spend so much money on death.

619
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,240
We've lost our connection to

620
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,160
our responsibility
for what our governments do.

621
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,840
And we get lost in our powerlessness,

622
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and we think we can change it
in a few moments.

623
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,000
People marched
against the war and it didn't work,

624
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,240
so everyone goes back to living
their lives again,

625
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,960
while what they
went to the streets for has become

626
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,360
a greater nightmare
than they could have ever imagined.

627
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,400
Why was it so horrible then

628
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,760
and not so horrible now
that no one's in the streets?

629
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,000
How you stop the government
is a very difficult question.

630
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,840
The only way one could do it
is by overthrowing that government,

631
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,840
by a revolution.

632
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,840
But then the notion of revolution
in our time is so archaic, so dépassé.

633
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,240
We don't think
in those terms anymore,

634
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,680
but that is the only way
to stop a government.

635
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,920
The most important step

636
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,840
that all the women of the world
can take

637
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,480
is not to give their children away

638
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,120
to be turned into soldiers,
to be turned into killers.

639
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,320
I come from a region where we all
started to hate each other,

640
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,880
and to kill each other savagely

641
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,680
as if the others were no longer human.

642
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,920
We have these disasters in which,
in a very short period of time,

643
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,640
a massive amount of destructive power
can be brought to bear.

644
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,240
The governments doing this
must be replaced.

645
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,400
The leaders individually responsible
for these actions

646
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,800
must be held to justice.

647
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,320
We've seen a wonderful trend
in the past twenty years

648
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,480
with General Pinochet
and a number of others,

649
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,280
whose actions led to genocide,
led to disappearances, led to death,

650
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,840
being brought before
world courts of justice.

651
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,240
So we must move to a world
in which every leader

652
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,000
is held accountable in the same way,

653
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,880
with the feeling that their actions
will be judged.

654
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,400
As a human being I feel that...
What is today's war?

655
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,200
We are killing each other
and it's something that

656
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,400
is taking peace away
from a lot of people.

657
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,920
Question 56.

658
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,400
From Moise Marabout, 23,

659
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,520
Agadez, Niger.

660
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,440
"Why is there no peace
in the Middle East yet?"

661
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,840
This question is extremely,
extremely, extremely,

662
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
extremely close to my heart
as an Israeli.

663
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,400
I can only say that, the way I see it,

664
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,240
there's no peace in the Middle East,

665
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,640
because of the vanity of Israel.

666
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,440
As long as justice is not addressed,

667
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,360
we will not have peace.

668
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,000
Peace is not a moment
between conflicts,

669
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,640
but a continuous state
one lives and strives for.

670
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,800
The only peace now

671
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
is false peace,

672
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,960
peace based upon lack of trust.

673
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,760
Oil.

674
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,880
I believe the reason is
that there are fanatics on both sides.

675
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,240
On both sides.

676
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,400
You can't ignore the fact that we are
deeply scarred as a people,

677
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,200
but instead of
trying to heal ourselves

678
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,800
by recognizing
that we must use compassion,

679
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,400
love and forgiveness,

680
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,840
and engage in dialogue eye to eye,

681
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,600
we keep hiding behind
our supposed righteousness,

682
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,640
but there is no such thing.

683
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,360
We feel like we can do anything,
because of what was done to us.

684
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,400
I believe Palestinians and Israelis
want to be able to coexist together.

685
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,720
The whole argument
that we were here first

686
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,680
that they were here first,
is irrelevant.

687
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,840
We are all visitors on this planet.

688
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,040
We are all strangers
walking on borrowed land.

689
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,640
Once Palestinians and Israelis
live equally with self-respect,

690
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,960
with respect to each other
and solidarity,

691
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,680
it will echo to the entire world.

692
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,840
It will stop these stupid battles

693
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,840
of the state deciding between the
culture of the West and the Muslims.

694
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,000
It's such bullshit.
In Israel and Palestine we can prove

695
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,040
that together this can be the most
beautiful culture one can have.

696
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,640
I know I sound like a dreamer...

697
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,800
In my country, in my community,
we normally say...

698
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,880
which means,

699
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,560
"Where two bulls fight, normally
the grass is the one that suffers."

700
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Question 61 from Wolfgang Jost,

701
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,160
23, Berlin, Germany...

702
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,280
"Why is an Iranian nuclear bomb"

703
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,880
"supposed to be more dangerous
than an American, Israeli or French?"

704
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,080
Let us not ask this question
in America or France or in Israel.

705
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
But let us ask this question

706
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,400
in Algeria or in Iraq,

707
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,720
or in Lebanon or in Palestine...

708
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,600
Or even Japan!

709
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,560
August 7, 1945.

710
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,360
America dropped a bomb on Hiroshima.

711
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,160
Some hundred thousand people
were killed, school children,

712
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,920
civilians,
and the killing went on for years,

713
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,160
because of the atomic consequences.

714
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,400
Who has really been using
those bombs, practically?

715
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,720
Until now, just the USA.

716
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,640
Iran pledges, promises,
to destroy Israel.

717
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,560
And there is no doubt that
if Iran were to have a nuclear bomb,

718
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,040
it would keep its promise.

719
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Israel? Israel's bombs?

720
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,160
Where do they come from?

721
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,400
We make those.

722
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,800
We sell them to Israel.

723
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,520
The American, Israeli and French bombs
should be eliminated.

724
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,400
France and the United States
have a legal obligation to do so

725
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,480
under
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

726
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,040
And Israel has a security interest

727
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:50,320
in really resolving the conflicts in
its region through non-violent means.

728
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,240
As long as some have nuclear weapons
others will want them.

729
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,000
As long as they want them,
they'll get them.

730
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,000
And as long as they exist,
it's inevitable

731
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,160
that either through accident
or design, they will be used.

732
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,200
Any use is catastrophic,
therefore they must be abolished.

733
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,240
Why do we have to have a nuclear bomb?

734
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,200
We shouldn't be...
If we were to start all over again,

735
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,600
no one would say that it was
a good idea to build nuclear bombs.

736
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,280
Insane!

737
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,960
Who would we be if we didn't live
in the shadow of the atomic bomb?

738
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,040
We would be very different people.

739
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,560
Would we live in this sense of fear
that is manipulated

740
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,320
by external powers so easily?

741
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,160
Would we still be allowing
the level of violence that we allow?

742
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,000
I don't think so.

743
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,720
I think we could have found
some wonderful ways

744
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,880
to deal with conflict
that wasn't violence.

745
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:06,360
And I do think
that who we are in the 21st Century

746
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,240
has deeply been affected

747
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,800
by the technological advances
in weaponry.

748
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,040
I don't think we fully understand

749
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,040
what that's done to our humanity,
what it's done

750
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,480
to American citizens
to have used the atomic bomb.

751
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,160
I think that contributes to how...

752
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
how violent our own inner nature is.

753
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,160
It has contributed
to the level of depression,

754
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,920
the level of addictions,

755
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,560
the disconnect and denial...

756
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,520
I think it would be
a very different world,

757
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,320
a very different world,

758
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,480
certainly one
more caring and generous...

759
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,600
Thank you.

760
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,080
Question 62 is from

761
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,400
the writer and activist Arundhati Roy.

762
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,640
"Between non-violent resistance
and armed struggle where do we go?"

763
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,280
"What is effective?"
"What is the right thing to do?"

764
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:38,000
"Or do we need
a biodiversity of resistance?"

765
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,840
Arundhati, if you could sit here
and hear this murmur...

766
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,440
and see all these faces.

767
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,240
I like the term
"biodiversity of resistance".

768
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,320
This is a great question

769
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,720
and I'm not sure
if we are the ones to answer it.

770
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,840
I would prefer to say that
I prefer a non-violent resistance.

771
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,240
I wish this resistance would make it.

772
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,320
But we are not the ones to choose
the resistance of the oppressed.

773
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,640
We certainly need
a variety of forms of resistance.

774
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,800
Armed struggle
must be the last resort,

775
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,840
and something
that we are very, very mindful of

776
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,240
and oftentimes suspicious of.

777
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,400
And yet there are conditions
under which armed struggle

778
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,120
becomes necessary.

779
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,280
For the most part we must deploy

780
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,160
all forms of non-violent resistance
and struggle,

781
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,240
understanding non-violence
as something active,

782
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,800
as something that's vital and vibrant,

783
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,760
something that requires our sacrifice,
our suffering,

784
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,640
something that allows us
to accent the best in ourselves

785
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,280
and the best in others.

786
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,400
The struggle for change

787
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,040
in every single place
where struggle has been successful

788
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,880
has employed what you term
a "biodiversity" of tactics.

789
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,400
From non-violent resistance

790
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,440
to political organizing,
to speechmaking

791
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,560
to armed struggle.

792
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Legitimate armed struggle
based on the principles laid down by

793
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,800
the African National Congress
and Che Guevara,

794
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,920
to distinguish between mere terrorism,

795
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,760
violence for its own sake
with unnecessary casualties,

796
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,680
and armed struggle that is undertaken
to mobilize and protect

797
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,960
an oppressed majority.

798
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,960
As an organizer,
whatever decision I make

799
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,120
and whatever movement
I'm engaged in, I have to ask myself:

800
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,960
Can I live with the impact
of the tactic I'm going to use?

801
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,760
It never happens
that when change is taking place,

802
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,400
that it does not affect others.

803
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,800
There are always victims of change.

804
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,440
Ask yourself:
How much are you willing to give?

805
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,480
How convinced are you of your goal?

806
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,480
And then you can choose the weapons.

807
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,400
It could be a pen, it could be a gun,

808
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
it could be a camera, it could be
a piece of paper, it could be a knife,

809
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,800
it could be your life.

810
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,360
We can accomplish a lot
with non-violent resistance.

811
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,800
But are there times
when armed struggles are justified?

812
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,480
Are revolutions justified?

813
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,640
Concentrating on resistance,
there's something wrong with that.

814
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,280
We're not just
concentrating on resistance.

815
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,840
We have to create "attractance".

816
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,680
We have to create a new paradigm,
which is attractive to go to.

817
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,960
If everyone were to bloom
in their own beauty... Imagine that!

818
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,040
Everyone sitting in a circle at this
table blooming in their own beauty.

819
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,360
Yes, Arundhati,

820
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,840
we need biodiversity on Earth.

821
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,240
It's everyone's language,
everyone's culture,

822
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,880
everyone's spiritual understanding.

823
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,760
At this very moment,
you can see around me

824
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,400
a circle that represents
a global community

825
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,560
where there is diversity,
diversity of thought,

826
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,720
diversity of ideas,
diversity of concepts.

827
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,280
Is anyone there listening to us?

828
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
At any time?

829
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,920
It will probably
be catapulted into the world

830
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,920
like a discus.

831
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,640
Great.

832
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,880
Yes? Does that sound good?
Oh good.

833
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,120
Can you take your head off?

834
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
So you can really feel
what's going on around you,

835
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,160
sense what's going on around you.

836
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,080
Or are you still
in your mind, thinking?

837
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,600
-Our friend the camera.
-Guys!

838
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,160
Whatever you hear from me,
if there is one smart thing,

839
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,320
take it and the rest please erase
it...

840
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,600
You also went to the centre.
How was the centre?

841
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,400
It was really good. It's amazing.
You can click onto the different...

842
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,440
You can go to any camera.

843
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,240
Question 75.

844
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,200
From Sara Francis,
35, Dublin, Ireland.

845
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
"What does courage mean now?"

846
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,160
"Courage is something
I appreciate so much in a person."

847
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,640
"I salute people who have courage."

848
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,320
"Courage helps you to continue
to live your day-to-day life."

849
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,480
"Courage is something...
Step by step, you go up!"

850
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,240
It takes courage to be a human being.
It takes courage to be!

851
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:39,560
Solitude is courage.
Hermetics. Total neutrality.

852
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,800
To be unsure of yourself is courage.

853
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,000
Courage is so many things.

854
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Courage is the courage
of Aung San Suu Kyi,

855
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,120
who is being kept

856
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,400
incommunicado
and under house arrest.

857
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,000
Courage is the courage of

858
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,160
the young students
in Tiananmen Square.

859
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:10,720
We risk our lives
in many different ways.

860
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,640
I've never really risked mine,
so I can't say.

861
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,000
I've never lived
in truly dangerous situations.

862
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,400
The way so many people
around this table have done.

863
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,120
To put it simply,
to be willing to die.

864
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,080
Yes, to be willing to die.

865
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,240
To have the courage
to take the risk to die,

866
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,160
to defend who I am and what I'm doing.

867
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,320
Well, I mean,
we're sitting in a square,

868
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:39,800
where the adventure of Nazism

869
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,560
took over
this beautiful country of Germany,

870
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,880
and distorted the laws of justice

871
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,400
in a most gross and horrific fashion.

872
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,720
Imagine the courage of people
that broke the laws of the state

873
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,040
to honour the higher law

874
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,200
of caring for human life.

875
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,880
You don't know
that Chinese prison labour camps

876
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,240
are similar to Soviet gulags,

877
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,000
or German concentration camps.

878
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,800
About 40 or 50 million people
lost their lives there.

879
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I was there for 19 years,

880
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
before I made it to America.

881
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,560
I didn't want to talk about this,

882
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,160
but finally I have,

883
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,040
because we have only one lifetime.

884
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,800
What would Argentina have been
without the courage

885
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,080
of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,

886
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,080
who stood up to the dictatorships
and terrorism

887
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,240
of the Generals Videla,
Massera and Agosti,

888
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,400
who "disappeared" thousands of people
by throwing them into the sea.

889
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,400
What would have become of us

890
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,280
without the lesson in courage
taught by these mothers,

891
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,840
who stood before the Casa de Gobierno
every Thursday

892
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,760
with the portraits
of their disappeared sons?

893
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,080
Courage means to understand

894
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,680
that these powers are not invincible,

895
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,240
as is being demonstrated
by people in the world,

896
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,960
who, with courage and indignation,

897
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,840
have managed to expel
transnationals from their countries,

898
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,800
have managed to overthrow

899
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,960
and topple governments.

900
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,240
Courage has everything to do with

901
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,640
looking at the future in the face,

902
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,240
always acknowledging
an element of the unknown,

903
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,400
but believing that if one sacrifices,

904
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,160
if one suffers,

905
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,560
if one takes a risk
and allows oneself to be vulnerable,

906
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,240
that one can still make a difference.

907
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,640
We should keep this in mind

908
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,240
and it should make us
all the more radical and motivated,

909
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,960
as we don't risk our lives,

910
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,160
just a little boredom,

911
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,200
a little ostracism,
a little of our well-being.

912
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,040
Courage is also not just about
changing this world.

913
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,640
It is really also about ensuring

914
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,560
that the present day world
does not change me.

915
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,760
Question 78.

916
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:24,000
From Nancy Clemons, 57,
Cameron, Missouri, USA...

917
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:29,160
"What can I do, and tell others to do,
to stop global warming?"

918
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,640
"What can I do, and tell others to do,
to stop global warming?"

919
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,360
Please begin.

920
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,480
This is a big question.

921
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:52,480
Quite simply, future generations
will not be able to understand

922
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,640
our delirium of destruction.

923
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,000
There's nothing we can do
to stop global warming.

924
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,640
The ice is going to
carry on melting away.

925
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,880
And now the question is:
Who will live?

926
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,640
Who will live a life worth living?

927
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,560
We know that many will perish.

928
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,400
We know that many more
will barely survive with no life.

929
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,120
Few will have a life worthy of living.

930
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:31,720
I pray to the Great One
and ask him again and pray again

931
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:36,760
that you and me will be able
to have a life worthy of living.

932
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,880
Because no matter
what you and I do today

933
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,200
there's no way of returning.

934
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,400
The ice will carry on melting
until it has ceased to exist.

935
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,400
Actually,
we can't stop global warming any more.

936
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,840
As an evolution biologist,
I firmly believe

937
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,240
that we cannot stop it any more.

938
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,560
However, we can slow it down.

939
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,840
Global warming is not about science.
It's about experience.

940
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,880
Science will give us the facts,
the data and it may move us to act.

941
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,440
But how we move
each other to act is a question

942
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,840
more of the heart than of the head.

943
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,400
We are all part of the problem,

944
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,560
but we can also be
part of the solution.

945
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,680
I could make a contribution
if I stop driving my car.

946
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:33,200
Transitions to bio fuels
and even large-scale wind and solar

947
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,240
would probably
not be sufficient to sustain

948
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,400
an industrial system
at the present scale.

949
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,960
So the answer is powering down.

950
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,400
Right now, hundreds of communities
are starting to take these steps.

951
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,760
They are engaged
in what is called "power down".

952
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,320
They are looking at
how they as communities

953
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,640
can take steps right now
to localize their economies.

954
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,800
They realize that if oil prices
shoot up or if there's scarcity,

955
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,960
they may find
the supermarket shelves empty.

956
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:11,040
That they won't
be able to heat their homes,

957
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,000
that they won't be able to travel.

958
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,960
We must talk about how to control

959
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,560
our cheap desire.

960
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,720
I think something
we can all do worldwide

961
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,880
is to shame and ridicule
the people who are polluting.

962
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,640
There won't be any state of emergency.

963
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,000
We have been for thousands of years

964
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,000
in a state of emergency.

965
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,560
We delude ourselves into thinking

966
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,040
that these problems are the creation

967
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,240
of our nation, government,
religion or race,

968
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
but this is not so.

969
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,840
The problem lies within

970
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,480
each individual's consciousness.

971
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,640
I don't believe in humankind.
No, I don't.

972
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,400
I tell you, I'm embarrassed
to belong to that race.

973
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,880
And at the same time,
I'm fascinated by it.

974
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,160
La belle et la bestia.

975
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,560
Question 83

976
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:34,400
is from the photographer
Sebastião Salgado

977
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,040
of Aimorés, Minas Gerais, Brazil...

978
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,760
"Can a person be perceptive enough
to see our planet"

979
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,960
"in a way that tells them
that they too are part of nature?"

980
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:53,240
We all start seeing clearer
and clearer the damage that's done.

981
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,640
We see it at our doorsteps.

982
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
We see and feel the climate changes,
the droughts and the flooding,

983
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,960
the storms and the heat.

984
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,160
We breathe the bad air.

985
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,000
We suffer from allergies.

986
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,000
We miss the taste in food.

987
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,000
We watch the forest die,

988
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,800
the animals and plants
endangered and disappearing.

989
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,360
And more and more of us understand

990
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,120
that the planet does not belong to us,

991
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:31,080
but that we belong to the Earth.

992
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,840
Since the 20th Century,

993
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:41,600
when man was able to escape gravity
and move into space,

994
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,320
we had pictures,
beautiful pictures of our planet,

995
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,960
that little bluish globe
floating through the universe.

996
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:55,480
As you look at those pictures, you
become almost sentimental and think:

997
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,520
I live on this planet,
I am part of this planet.

998
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,400
Go out into a field
and lie down at night

999
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,040
and look down into the stars.

1000
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,680
Pretend gravity has you glued
to the bottom of the planet,

1001
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,480
because how do you know
which way is up?

1002
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,520
The reason why little children
love animals is because

1003
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:20,400
we have co-evolved
with the rest of creation.

1004
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:25,720
We have lived close to nature
for almost all our evolution.

1005
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:31,000
This little blip of modern life
cut off from the Earth,

1006
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:35,160
cut off from other animals
and cut off from one another

1007
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,880
has only happened,

1008
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,640
because we've also become
cut off from ourselves,

1009
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,840
from our own hearts,
from our own bodies.

1010
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,840
Nature makes the most sophisticated
materials on the planet

1011
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,640
out of carbohydrates.

1012
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,000
We too can learn how to do that.

1013
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,120
But we have thought ourselves
to be superior to nature.

1014
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,640
We haven't looked at her four and
a half billion years of experience

1015
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,080
in incredible technologies.

1016
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,240
Take a wasps' nest.

1017
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,960
It's a building
that hangs from a single thread

1018
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,080
made of material so light
that it can hold

1019
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,840
three hundred times
its own weight in inhabitants.

1020
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Can we learn
to make buildings like that?

1021
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,840
Can we grow skyscrapers from
the bottom up the way a reed grows,

1022
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,640
by building new cells at the bottom
of it and pushing itself upward?

1023
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,200
We have so much to learn from nature.

1024
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:34,400
It is by our own free choice,

1025
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,560
by our personal efforts,

1026
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,720
that we will achieve
balance with nature

1027
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,840
and so become like all of nature.

1028
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,640
Then we will feel

1029
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,480
the eternity, perfection and harmony

1030
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,640
that is everywhere in nature

1031
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,800
except within our ourselves.

1032
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,840
Everything we eat,
everything we wear,

1033
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,160
all our houses, all our objects
come from the living Earth.

1034
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,400
Learning how to live from that Earth
in a way that is sustainable

1035
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,040
is not utopian, is not a dream.

1036
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,640
What stands between us
and that possibility

1037
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,400
is the idea that it can't be done,

1038
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,640
the idea that they are too powerful,

1039
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,240
that corporations can't change,

1040
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,640
the idea
that people don't want change,

1041
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,800
the idea that all of this comes
from innate human greed,

1042
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,480
that it comes from overpopulation.

1043
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,240
The planet is too crowded,

1044
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,720
therefore it's not possible
to provide for people.

1045
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,040
All of these are myths
that need to be reassessed,

1046
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,840
assumptions that need to be rethought.

1047
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,400
Question 96 comes from Miraj Khaled,

1048
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
30, from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

1049
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,160
"What is God's religion?", she asks.

1050
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,760
"What is God's religion?"
Please begin.

1051
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,240
I loved that question when I saw it,

1052
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,320
because I think it's very perceptive.

1053
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,040
Which God?

1054
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,840
Which Religion?

1055
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
What God? Whose God?

1056
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,880
Whichever way we want to take it,

1057
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,040
we must respect how others

1058
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,200
see this word "God".

1059
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
God is a way of defining

1060
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,160
certain archetypes,

1061
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,560
certain expectations

1062
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,760
and objectives.

1063
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,040
God is "is-ness".

1064
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,880
God is spirit. God is not religion.
God doesn't have a religion.

1065
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,720
God doesn't exist.

1066
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,440
The religion of my Goddess

1067
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,080
is reflected
in every corner of the world,

1068
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,760
in every... leaf,

1069
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,560
in every speck of dirt,

1070
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,440
in every... flower.

1071
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,640
No, I don't believe
that God has a religion.

1072
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:12,440
I think that religion
is a profoundly human phenomenon.

1073
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,280
When we talk about
God having a religion,

1074
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,920
you can rest assured

1075
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,880
that we're talking about
some human construction,

1076
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,800
some human creation.

1077
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,840
What we project onto Him.

1078
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,840
I am of Love.

1079
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,760
I am of the Universe.

1080
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,040
I am God in Action.

1081
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,000
There is no God.

1082
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,160
God is a symbol for something

1083
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,800
that we can't express in words.

1084
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:46,000
And that's also why
there's no God's religion.

1085
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,000
God, we have to imagine, is something

1086
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,640
that is not only unknown to us,

1087
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,280
but is also beyond our knowledge,

1088
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,840
that has no quality of being known.

1089
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,400
It's as if
we were to ask the question,

1090
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:07,200
what is the colour of a circle?

1091
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,160
Is it red, green or blue?

1092
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,840
It's neither blue nor red nor green.

1093
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
It's also not colourless.

1094
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,640
The question about the colour
of the circle is absurd,

1095
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,280
because a circle knows no colour.

1096
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,840
Many people are unwilling to see this.

1097
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,240
They take a pen out of their pocket,

1098
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
draw a circle on a piece of paper

1099
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,400
and say, "Look, this circle is blue."

1100
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,680
Yes, the circle drawn by them is blue,

1101
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,840
but the colour comes from my pen,

1102
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,000
and not from the circle.

1103
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,640
The colour of the pen is the religion

1104
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,400
with which we express the divinity,

1105
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,560
but we cannot
draw the circle ourselves.

1106
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,040
It is something
that has nothing to do with colours.

1107
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,120
There are as many religions

1108
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,360
as there are colours
with which I can draw a circle.

1109
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I really like that one.

1110
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,720
I believe in God,
but all I know about God is,

1111
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,200
there is a God and it isn't me.

1112
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,840
That's all I know so far.

1113
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,240
Don't you think
God is in you as well?

1114
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,560
Oh absolutely. Absolutely.

1115
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,400
Most of my whole thing
with spirituality is...

1116
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,600
I'm a recovering heroin addict.

1117
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,480
I haven't met God yet.

1118
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,400
If I meet Him one day,

1119
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,280
then I will ask Him the questions.

1120
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,680
-Thank you.
-Thank you, too.

1121
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,320
-Last one.
-Question...

1122
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,320
-100!
-100.

1123
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:45,200
-Last one.
-I didn't think we'd make it!

1124
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,480
Okay, last question. Let's do it.

1125
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:06,800
From Keith Dierkx, 48,
Piedmont, California, USA.

1126
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,640
"What are the myths
that we need to create"

1127
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,200
"to change the world for the better?"

1128
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,160
Creation stories are part of every
culture in human history,

1129
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:21,120
and they were usually told
by some kind of a priesthood.

1130
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,760
But now science
tells the creation story.

1131
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,080
It has been elevated
to that status of priesthood

1132
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,240
that gets to tell
the big story to the culture.

1133
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,400
What story is it telling us?

1134
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,240
That we live in a non-living,
purposeless universe

1135
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,240
running down by entropy.

1136
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,880
Oh! How cheery is that
for a creation story?

1137
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,680
And then we add in
that evolution on this planet

1138
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,480
is about the survival of the fittest,

1139
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,520
about an endless competition
in scarcity,

1140
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,680
and that you have to get
what you can while you can

1141
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,840
and beat the other guy to it.

1142
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
This is a totally depressing
creation story,

1143
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,760
a universe running down meaninglessly,

1144
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,640
you're stuck
in an endless struggle in scarcity.

1145
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:13,040
This is a terrible story to tell.
It doesn't fit the scientific facts.

1146
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,920
Every force in nature has an opposite.

1147
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,160
If there's entropy,
there has to be syntropy.

1148
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,480
In evolution there's a tremendous
amount of cooperation.

1149
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,640
In fact, I'd say there's a great story

1150
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,200
in the maturation cycle
of evolving species,

1151
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:32,920
where they first are young and grabby

1152
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,240
they multiply
and take all the territory they can,

1153
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,640
bump off their competitors,
act like capitalists.

1154
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,280
And then they discover, bit by bit,
the advantages of cooperation.

1155
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:50,000
And, as they do so, they build bigger
and bigger cooperative enterprises

1156
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,680
and find out
that their economies are cheaper,

1157
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,840
more effective, more efficient,
work for everybody,

1158
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,520
and you get
the evolution of rainforests,

1159
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,680
and human bodies
made of a hundred trillion cells,

1160
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,080
working in complete cooperation
even though they're so diverse.

1161
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:10,240
This is a story we need to tell
in the world, a great new story

1162
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,400
of the human species
growing up into global family,

1163
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,800
doing win-win economics
and making a better world for all.

1164
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:23,120
Human beings are appreciators,

1165
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,800
not just observers
but appreciators, participants,

1166
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,000
even co-creators
of the cosmic process.

1167
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:36,800
The whole world is deeply entangled.

1168
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:41,840
All the living organisms,
all the parts of the universe.

1169
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
The whole universe is living,

1170
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,240
the electrons
and the protons and everything.

1171
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,240
They are all organisms.

1172
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:54,400
They all have a history
and they are all entangled so deeply,

1173
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,040
intimately interconnected,
that you cannot separate them.

1174
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,840
And, at any moment,
this entangled universe

1175
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,840
is creating
and recreating itself anew.

1176
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
That, I think,
is the evolution of the cosmos,

1177
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:16,640
the evolution of all things in it
from atoms, to humans, to galaxies.

1178
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,280
That is the objective.
That is the ambition.

1179
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,400
That is the ultimate aim
of divine creativity.

1180
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,800
That's as far as we can come
as human beings to understand it.

1181
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,560
I believe

1182
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:38,040
in a measure of humility,

1183
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,480
and in a measure of humanity,

1184
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,280
and in an avowal of beauty

1185
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:48,840
as an antidote to all the brutality,

1186
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
and cruelty of the world.

1187
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,560
I believe

1188
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,440
that the sacred lives in nature,

1189
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,600
not only in the supernatural,

1190
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,200
but also in the beauty of nature.

1191
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,080
I believe

1192
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,040
human beings
are metaphysical animals,

1193
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,680
and always will be
because of their mortality.

1194
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,840
The human is the only animal
that knows it must die.

1195
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,240
This is the source of the mystery,

1196
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,400
of the unending mystery
of human existence.

1197
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,800
It would have to do
with the marrying of the mind,

1198
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:28,200
the soul,
and this corporeal little covering

1199
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,520
that is supposed to be the body.

1200
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,880
The marriage of all those,

1201
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,640
if it indeed be that,

1202
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,200
can only be powered by positivity.

1203
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,840
And if the positivity

1204
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,560
then manages
to give birth to that marriage...

1205
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:51,640
then all the troubles of the Earth
will be gone.

1206
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,080
If the human mind has got the space

1207
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:59,240
in which to breathe,
to live, to pulse, to flow...

1208
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:24,080
Who is ever going
to listen to all of this?

1209
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,640
Because we're one hundred and twelve,
there are a hundred questions.

1210
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That's 11,200. Let's say...

1211
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Only two minutes each time.
That's 22,000 minutes.

1212
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,160
You know what that is?

1213
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:44,240
That's three hundred days.

1214
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,880
Okay, we're finished.

1215
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,400
It's over.

1216
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:48,320
